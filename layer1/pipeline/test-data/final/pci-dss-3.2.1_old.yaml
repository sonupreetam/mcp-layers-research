      title: Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data Firewalls are devices that control computer traffic allowed between an entity’s networks (internal) and untrusted networks (external), as well as traffic into and out of more sensitive areas within an entity’s internal trusted networks. The cardholder data environment is an example of a more sensitive area within an entity’s trusted network. A firewall examines all network traffic and blocks those transmissions that do not meet the specified security criteria. All systems must be protected from unauthorized access from untrusted networks, whether entering the system via the Internet as e-commerce, employee Internet access through desktop browsers, employee e-mail access, dedicated connections such as business-to-business connections, via wireless networks, or via other sources. Often, seemingly insignificant paths to and from untrusted networks can provide unprotected pathways into key systems. Firewalls are a key protection mechanism for any computer network. Other system components may provide firewall functionality, as long as they meet the minimum requirements for firewalls as defined in Requirement 1. Where other system components are used within the cardholder data environment to provide firewall functionality, these devices must be included within the scope and assessment of Requirement 1.

            - This document, PCI Data Security Standard Requirements and Security Assessment Procedures, combines the 12 PCI DSS requirements and corresponding testing procedures into a security assessment tool. It is designed for use during PCI DSS compliance assessments as part of an entity’s validation process. The following sections provide detailed guidelines and best practices to assist entities prepare for, conduct, and report the results of a PCI DSS assessment. The PCI DSS Requirements and Testing Procedures begin on page 15.
            - 'The PCI DSS security requirements apply to all system components included in or connected to the cardholder data environment. The cardholder data environment (CDE) is comprised of people, processes and technologies that store, process, or transmit cardholder data or sensitive authentication data. “System components” include network devices, servers, computing devices, and applications. Examples of system components include but are not limited to the following:    Systems that provide security services (for example, authentication servers), facilitate segmentation (for example, internal firewalls), or may impact the security of (for example, name resolution or web redirection servers) the CDE.    Virtualization components such as virtual machines, virtual switches/routers, virtual appliances, virtual applications/desktops, and hypervisors.    Network components including but not limited to firewalls, switches, routers, wireless access points, network appliances, and other security appliances.    Server types including but not limited to web, application, database, authentication, mail, proxy, Network Time Protocol (NTP), and Domain Name System (DNS).    Applications including all purchased and custom applications, including internal and external (for example, Internet) applications.    Any other component or device located within or connected to the CDE.'
            - Wireless If wireless technology is used to store, process, or transmit cardholder data (for example, point-of-sale transactions, “line-busting”), or if a wireless local area network (WLAN) is part of, or connected to the cardholder data environment, the PCI DSS requirements and testing procedures for wireless environments apply and must be performed (for example, Requirements 1.2.3, 2.1.1, and 4.1.1). Before wireless technology is implemented, an entity should carefully evaluate the need for the technology against the risk. Consider deploying wireless technology only for non- sensitive data transmission.
            - 'To ensure security controls continue to be properly implemented, PCI DSS should be implemented into business-as-usual (BAU) activities as part of an entity’s overall security strategy. This enables an entity to monitor the effectiveness of their security controls on an ongoing basis, and maintain their PCI DSS compliant environment in between PCI DSS assessments. Examples of how to incorporate PCI DSS into BAU activities include but are not limited to:'
            - 'Sampling is an option for assessors to facilitate the assessment process where there are large numbers of business facilities and/or system components. While it is acceptable for an assessor to sample business facilities/system components as part of their review of an entity’s PCI DSS compliance, it is not acceptable for an entity to apply PCI DSS requirements to only a sample of their environment (for example, requirements for quarterly vulnerability scans apply to all system components). Similarly, it is not acceptable for an assessor to only review a sample of PCI DSS requirements for compliance. After considering the overall scope and complexity of the environment being assessed, the assessor may independently select representative samples of business facilities/system components in order to assess the entity’s compliance with PCI DSS requirements. These samples must be defined first for business facilities and then for system components within each selected business facility. Samples must be a representative selection of all of the types and locations of business facilities, as well as all of the types of system components within selected business facilities. Samples must be sufficiently large to provide the assessor with assurance that controls are implemented as expected. Examples of business facilities include but are not limited to: corporate offices, stores, franchise locations, processing facilities, data centers, and other facility types in different locations. Sampling should include system components within each selected business facility. For example, for each business facility selected, include a variety of operating systems, functions, and applications that are applicable to the area under review. As an example, the assessor may define a sample at a business facility to include Sun servers running Apache, Windows servers running Oracle, mainframe systems running legacy card processing applications, data-transfer servers running HP-UX, and Linux Servers running MySQL. If all applications run from a single version of an OS (for example, Windows 7 or Solaris 10), the sample should still include a variety of applications (for example, database servers, web servers, data-transfer servers). When independently selecting samples of business facilities/system components, assessors should consider the following:    If there are standardized, centralized PCI DSS security and operational processes and controls in place that ensure consistency and that each business facility/system component must follow, the sample can be smaller than if there are no standard processes/controls in place. The sample must be large enough to provide the assessor with reasonable assurance that all business facilities/system components are configured per the standard processes. The assessor must verify that the standardized, centralized controls are implemented and working effectively.    If there is more than one type of standard security and/or operational process in place (for example, for different types of business facilities/system components), the sample must be large enough to include business facilities/system components secured with each type of process.    If there are no standard PCI DSS processes/controls in place and each business facility/system component is managed through non- standard processes, the sample must be larger for the assessor to be assured that each business facility/system component has implemented PCI DSS requirements appropriately.'
            - including documentation of all compensating controls, according to the applicable PCI guidance and instructions.
            - 'The following defines the column headings for the PCI DSS Requirements and Security Assessment Procedures:        PCI DSS Requirements – This column defines the Data Security Standard requirements; PCI DSS compliance is validated against these requirements.        Testing Procedures – This column shows processes to be followed by the assessor to validate that PCI DSS requirements have been met and are “in place.”        Guidance – This column describes the intent or security objective behind each of the PCI DSS requirements.

      title: Protect stored cardholder data Protection methods such as encryption, truncation, masking, and hashing are critical components of cardholder data protection. If an intruder circumvents other security controls and gains access to encrypted data, without the proper cryptographic keys, the data is unreadable and unusable to that person. Other effective methods of protecting stored data should also be considered as potential risk mitigation opportunities. For example, methods for minimizing risk include not storing cardholder data unless absolutely necessary, truncating cardholder data if full PAN is not needed, and not sending unprotected PANs using end-user messaging technologies, such as e-mail and instant messaging. Please refer to the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms for definitions of “strong cryptography” and other PCI DSS terms.

Anti-virus software must be used on all systems commonly affected by malware to protect systems from current and evolving malicious software threats. Additional anti-malware solutions may be considered as a supplement to the anti-virus software; however, such additional solutions do not replace the need for anti-virus software to be in place.

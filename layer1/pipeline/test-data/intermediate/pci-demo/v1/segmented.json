PCI DSS provides a baseline of technical and operational requirements designed to protect account data. PCI DSS applies to all entities involved in payment card processing—including merchants, processors, acquirers, issuers, and service providers. PCI DSS also applies to all other entities that store, process or transmit cardholder data (CHD) and/or sensitive authentication data (SAD). Below is a high-level overview of the 12 PCI DSS requirements.\n\nPCI Data Security Standard – High Level Overview",

            "Applicability of PCI DSS to PA-DSS Applications Use of a Payment Application Data Security Standard (PA-DSS) compliant application by itself does not make an entity PCI DSS compliant, since that application must be implemented into a PCI DSS compliant environment and according to the PA-DSS Implementation Guide provided by the payment application vendor. All applications that store, process, or transmit cardholder data are in scope for an entity’s PCI DSS assessment, including applications that have been validated to PA-DSS. The PCI DSS assessment should verify the PA-DSS validated payment application is properly configured and securely implemented per PCI DSS requirements. If the payment application has undergone any customization, a more in-depth review will be required during the PCI DSS assessment, as the application may no longer be representative of the version that was validated to PA-DSS. The PA-DSS requirements are derived from the PCI DSS Requirements and Security Assessment Procedures (defined in this document). The PA-DSS details the requirements a payment application must meet in order to facilitate a customer’s PCI DSS compliance. As security threats are constantly evolving, applications that are no longer supported by the vendor (e.g., identified by the vendor as “end of life”) may not offer the same level of security as supported versions. Secure payment applications, when implemented in a PCI DSS-compliant environment, will minimize the potential for security breaches leading to compromises of PAN, full track data, card verification codes and values (CAV2, CID, CVC2, CVV2), and PINs and PIN blocks, along with the damaging fraud resulting from these breaches. To determine whether PA-DSS applies to a given payment application, please refer to the PA-DSS Program Guide, which can be found at www.pcisecuritystandards.org.",
            "The first step of a PCI DSS assessment is to accurately determine the scope of the review. At least annually and prior to the annual assessment, the assessed entity should confirm the accuracy of their PCI DSS scope by identifying all locations and flows of cardholder data, and identify all systems that are connected to or, if compromised, could impact the CDE (for example, authentication servers) to ensure they are included in the PCI DSS scope. All types of systems and locations should be considered as part of the scoping process, including backup/recovery sites and fail- over systems.",
            "To confirm the accuracy of the defined CDE, perform the following:  The assessed entity identifies and documents the existence of all cardholder data in their environment, to verify that no cardholder data exists outside of the currently defined CDE.  Once all locations of cardholder data are identified and documented, the entity uses the results to verify that PCI DSS scope is appropriate (for example, the results may be a diagram or an inventory of cardholder data locations).  The entity considers any cardholder data found to be in scope of the PCI DSS assessment and part of the CDE. If the entity identifies data that is not currently included in the CDE, such data should be securely deleted, migrated into the currently defined CDE, or the CDE redefined to include this data. The entity retains documentation that shows how PCI DSS scope was determined. The documentation is retained for assessor review and/or for reference during the next annual PCI DSS scope confirmation activity. For each PCI DSS assessment, the assessor is required to validate that the scope of the assessment is accurately defined and documented.",
            "Network segmentation of, or isolating (segmenting), the cardholder data environment from the remainder of an entity’s network is not a PCI DSS requirement. However, it is strongly recommended as a method that may reduce:  The scope of the PCI DSS assessment  The cost of the PCI DSS assessment  The cost and difficulty of implementing and maintaining PCI DSS controls  The risk to an organization (reduced by consolidating cardholder data into fewer, more controlled locations) Without adequate network segmentation (sometimes called a \"flat network\") the entire network is in scope of the PCI DSS assessment. Network segmentation can be achieved through a number of physical or logical means, such as properly configured internal network firewalls, routers with strong access control lists, or other technologies that restrict access to a particular segment of a network. To be considered out of scope for PCI DSS, a system component must be properly isolated (segmented) from the CDE, such that even if the out-of-scope system component was compromised it could not impact the security of the CDE. An important prerequisite to reduce the scope of the cardholder data environment is a clear understanding of business needs and processes related to the storage, processing or transmission of cardholder data. Restricting cardholder data to as few locations as possible by elimination of unnecessary data, and consolidation of necessary data, may require reengineering of long-standing business practices. Documenting cardholder data flows via a dataflow diagram helps fully understand all cardholder data flows and ensures that any network segmentation is effective at isolating the cardholder data environment. If network segmentation is in place and being used to reduce the scope of the PCI DSS assessment, the assessor must verify that the segmentation is adequate to reduce the scope of the assessment. At a high level, adequate network segmentation isolates systems that store, process, or transmit cardholder data from those that do not. However, the adequacy of a specific implementation of network segmentation is highly variable and dependent upon a number of factors, such as a given network's configuration, the technologies deployed, and other controls that may be implemented. Appendix D: Segmentation and Sampling of Business Facilities/System Components provides more information on the effect of network segmentation and sampling on the scope of a PCI DSS assessment.",
            "Wireless If wireless technology is used to store, process, or transmit cardholder data (for example, point-of-sale transactions, “line-busting”), or if a wireless local area network (WLAN) is part of, or connected to the cardholder data environment, the PCI DSS requirements and testing procedures for wireless environments apply and must be performed (for example, Requirements 1.2.3, 2.1.1, and 4.1.1). Before wireless technology is implemented, an entity should carefully evaluate the need for the technology against the risk. Consider deploying wireless technology only for non- sensitive data transmission.",
            "A service provider or merchant may use a third-party service provider to store, process, or transmit cardholder data on their behalf, or to manage components such as routers, firewalls, databases, physical security, and/or servers. If so, there may be an impact on the security of the cardholder data environment. Parties should clearly identify the services and system components which are included in the scope of the service provider’s PCI DSS assessment, the specific PCI DSS requirements covered by the service provider, and any requirements which are the responsibility of the service provider’s customers to include in their own PCI DSS reviews. For example, a managed hosting provider should clearly define which of their IP addresses are scanned as part of their quarterly vulnerability scan process and which IP addresses are their customer’s responsibility to include in their own quarterly scans. Service providers are responsible for demonstrating their PCI DSS compliance, and may be required to do so by the payment brands. Service providers should contact their acquirer and/or payment brand to determine the appropriate compliance validation. There are two options for third-party service providers to validate compliance: 1) Annual assessment: Service providers can undergo an annual PCI DSS assessment(s) on their own and provide evidence to their customers to demonstrate their compliance; or 2) Multiple, on-demand assessments: If they do not undergo their own annual PCI DSS assessments, service providers must undergo assessments upon request of their customers and/or participate in each of their customer’s PCI DSS reviews, with the results of each review provided to the respective customer(s) If the third party undergoes their own PCI DSS assessment, they should provide sufficient evidence to their customers to verify that the scope of the service provider’s PCI DSS assessment covered the services applicable to the customer and that the relevant PCI DSS requirements were examined and determined to be in place. The specific type of evidence provided by the service provider to their customers will depend on the agreements/contracts in place between those parties. For example, providing the AOC and/or relevant sections of the service provider’s ROC (redacted to protect any confidential information) could help provide all or some of the information. Additionally, merchants and service providers must manage and monitor the PCI DSS compliance of all associated third-party service providers with access to cardholder data. Refer to Requirement 12.8 in this document for details.",
            "To ensure security controls continue to be properly implemented, PCI DSS should be implemented into business-as-usual (BAU) activities as part of an entity’s overall security strategy. This enables an entity to monitor the effectiveness of their security controls on an ongoing basis, and maintain their PCI DSS compliant environment in between PCI DSS assessments.

The frequency of periodic reviews should be determined by the entity as appropriate for the size and complexity of their environment. These reviews can also be used to verify that appropriate evidence is being maintained—for example, audit logs, vulnerability scan reports, firewall reviews, etc.—to assist the entity’s preparation for their next compliance assessment.",
            "the entity’s security requirements, including PCI DSS. If it is discovered that technologies are no longer supported by the vendor or cannot meet the entity’s security needs, the entity should prepare a remediation plan, up to and including replacement of the technology, as necessary. In addition to the above practices, organizations may also wish to consider implementing separation of duties for their security functions so that security and/or audit functions are separated from operational functions. In environments where one individual performs multiple roles (for example, administration and security operations), duties may be assigned such that no single individual has end-to-end control of a process without an independent checkpoint. For example, responsibility for configuration and responsibility for approving changes could be assigned to separate individuals.",
            "All organizations should consider implementing these best practices into their environment, even where the organization is not required to validate to them.",
            "Sampling is an option for assessors to facilitate the assessment process where there are large numbers of business facilities and/or system components. While it is acceptable for an assessor to sample business facilities/system components as part of their review of an entity’s PCI DSS compliance, it is not acceptable for an entity to apply PCI DSS requirements to only a sample of their environment (for example, requirements for quarterly vulnerability scans apply to all system components). Similarly, it is not acceptable for an assessor to only review a sample of PCI DSS requirements for compliance. After considering the overall scope and complexity of the environment being assessed, the assessor may independently select representative samples of business facilities/system components in order to assess the entity’s compliance with PCI DSS requirements. These samples must be defined first for business facilities and then for system components within each selected business facility. Samples must be a representative selection of all of the types and locations of business facilities, as well as all of the types of system components within selected business facilities. Samples must be sufficiently large to provide the assessor with assurance that controls are implemented as expected. Examples of business facilities include but are not limited to: corporate offices, stores, franchise locations, processing facilities, data centers, and other facility types in different locations. Sampling should include system components within each selected business facility. For example, for each business facility selected, include a variety of operating systems, functions, and applications that are applicable to the area under review. As an example, the assessor may define a sample at a business facility to include Sun servers running Apache, Windows servers running Oracle, mainframe systems running legacy card processing applications, data-transfer servers running HP-UX, and Linux Servers running MySQL. If all applications run from a single version of an OS (for example, Windows 7 or Solaris 10), the sample should still include a variety of applications (for example, database servers, web servers, data-transfer servers). When independently selecting samples of business facilities/system components, assessors should consider the following:  If there are standardized, centralized PCI DSS security and operational processes and controls in place that ensure consistency and that each business facility/system component must follow, the sample can be smaller than if there are no standard processes/controls in place. The sample must be large enough to provide the assessor with reasonable assurance that all business facilities/system components are configured per the standard processes. The assessor must verify that the standardized, centralized controls are implemented and working effectively.  If there is more than one type of standard security and/or operational process in place (for example, for different types of business facilities/system components), the sample must be large enough to include business facilities/system components secured with each type of process.  If there are no standard PCI DSS processes/controls in place and each business facility/system component is managed through non- standard processes, the sample must be larger for the assessor to be assured that each business facility/system component has implemented PCI DSS requirements appropriately.",
            "sample must include all versions and platforms for each type of application.",
            "For each instance where sampling is used, the assessor must: Please also refer to:  Document the rationale behind the sampling technique and sample size, Appendix D: Segmentation and Sampling of Business  Document and validate the standardized PCI DSS processes and controls used to determine sample Facilities/System size, and Components.  Explain how the sample is appropriate and representative of the overall population. Assessors must revalidate the sampling rationale for each assessment. If sampling is to be used, different samples of business facilities and system components must be selected for each assessment.",
            "Compensating Controls On an annual basis, any compensating controls must be documented, reviewed and validated by the assessor and included with the Report on Compliance submission, per Appendix B: Compensating Controls and Appendix C: Compensating Controls Worksheet. For each and every compensating control, the Compensating Controls Worksheet (Appendix C) must be completed. Additionally, compensating control results should be documented in the ROC in the corresponding PCI DSS requirement section.

The cardholder data environment is an example of a more sensitive area within an entity’s trusted network. A firewall examines all network traffic and blocks those transmissions that do not meet the specified security criteria. All systems must be protected from unauthorized access from untrusted networks, whether entering the system via the Internet as e-commerce, employee Internet access through desktop browsers, employee e-mail access, dedicated connections such as business-to-business connections, via wireless networks, or via other sources. Often, seemingly insignificant paths to and from untrusted networks can provide unprotected pathways into key systems. Firewalls are a key protection mechanism for any computer network. Other system components may provide firewall functionality, as long as they meet the minimum requirements for firewalls as defined in Requirement 1. Where other system components are used within the cardholder data environment to provide firewall functionality, these devices must be included within the scope and assessment of Requirement 1.",
